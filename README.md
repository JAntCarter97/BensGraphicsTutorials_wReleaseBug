# BensGraphicsTutorials_wReleaseBug
From Ben Arnold's Advanced c++ Graphics Tutorial series.

Compiler and Linker error in Release Mode using Visual studio Update 2 RC

Use with Visual Studio Update 3 or newer.

Important Note: The member variables use an _memberVar

convention in the first 40 videos and should be of the m_memberVar convention

due to the compiler having reserved keynames starting with an underscore.
